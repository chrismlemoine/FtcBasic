/*
 * This file contains an example of a Linear "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When a selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode is executed.
 *
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use an external "hardware" class to modularize all the robot's sensors and actuators.
 * This approach is very efficient because the same hardware class can be used by all of your teleop and autonomous OpModes
 * without requiring many copy & paste operations.  Once you have defined and tested the hardware class with one OpMode,
 * it is instantly available to other OpModes.
 *
 * The real benefit of this approach is that as you tweak your robot hardware, you only need to make changes in ONE place (the Hardware Class).
 * So, to be effective, you should put as much or your hardware setup and access code as possible in the hardware class.
 * Essentially, anything you do with hardware in BOTH Teleop and Auto should likely go in the hardware class.
 *
 * The Hardware Class is created in a separate file, and then an "instance" of this class is created in each OpMode.
 * In order for the class to do typical OpMode things (like send telemetry data), it must be passed a reference to the
 * OpMode object when it's created, so it can access all core OpMode functions.  This is illustrated below.
 *
 * This particular OpMode illustrates driving a 4-motor Omni-Directional (or Holonomic) robot.
 * This code will work with either a Mecanum-Drive or an X-Drive train.
 * Both of these drives are illustrated at https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/holonomic.html
 * Note that a Mecanum drive must display an X roller-pattern when viewed from above.
 *
 * Holonomic drives provide the ability for the robot to move in three axes (directions) simultaneously.
 * Each motion axis is controlled by one Joystick axis.
 *
 * 1) Axial: Driving forward and backward Left-joystick Forward/Backward
 * 2) Lateral: Strafing right and left Left-joystick Right and Left
 * 3) Yaw: Rotating Clockwise and counterclockwise Right-joystick Right and Left
 *
 * This code is written assuming that the right-side motors need to be reversed for the robot to drive forward.
 * When you first test your robot, if it moves backward when you push the left stick forward, then you must flip
 * the direction of all 4 motors (see code below).
